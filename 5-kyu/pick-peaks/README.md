Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be <code>{pos: [], peaks: []}</code>.</p><p>Example: <code>pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])</code> should return <code>{pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]}</code> (or equivalent in other languages)</p><p>All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty), so you won't need to validate the input.</p><p>The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).</p><p>Also, beware of plateaus !!! <code>[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]</code> has a peak while <code>[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]</code> and <code>[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]</code> do not. In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position and value of the beginning of the plateau. For example: <code>pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])</code> returns <code>{pos: [1], peaks: [2]}</code> (or equivalent in other languages)</p><p>Have fun!</p>
